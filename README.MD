These are my dotfiles for my void linux install. Upon distro-hopping from arch, I decided that I would hop more than distros. As such, I am using a different WM, a different bar, maybe a different shell in the future, and a different customization of the terminal. As such, I have decided to make a separate repo for these new dotfiles. Feel free to use them, but I'm not taking responsibility if these cause damage to your computer.
